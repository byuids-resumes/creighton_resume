## Aubrey's edits for David's Resume

- I get an error when I click on your github link
- Do you need a summary at the top? I've heard conflicting opinions on summaries, so you might not need one!
- It's pretty long. I would suggest limiting each job to 4-6 bullet points with the most relevent tasks
- "Data Science Job Experience" I would call this section something else, since your whole "Related Experience
- Everything else looks great!! Good job! Sorry I don't have more edits.
